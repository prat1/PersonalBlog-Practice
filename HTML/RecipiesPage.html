          Add salt according to taste and 2 tbps of tumeric powder to it. Also add ginger garlic paste, yogurt,garam masala, some corriender and mint leaves, biriyani masala powder, ghee, green chillies, red chilli powder to it.

          In another pan add oil and deep fry onions untill golden brown and then add the onions to the chicken marinate.</p>
          <p id=procedure>
            Now take the basmati rice and soak it in warm water for 30 minutes and add salt and whole spieces to it and boil and cook the rice till 75 percent.
            Strain the water out and take a big low pan and add some oil to it and add whole spieces to it and stir them until brown. Add chicken and add the half cooked rice on top and fix a lit on top and let it cook for 45 minutes
